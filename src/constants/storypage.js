const Story = `
Come join us. We are the sailors who have sailed to the end of world and back. People call us "Black Hawks".
We are ones who have been working under the hood to maintain the balance of this world.

Our master, who created a beautiful bird that helped us things from afar. We have been using this to explore and fight untold and unspoken evil.
We have been informed that the people from the lands have used sorcery to steal that bird can see everything 
from a far and follows as per the will of its master

These are desperate times when we need you to get into your excavation intellect and help us to retrieve our bird back to us. 


We found few scraps from the ship which was carrying the bird last time. 
We couldn't make anything out of it, give it a look. 
We assume that this is something related to our real master where he created this bird. This will guide our path.  



Clue 1 - 

Oh creator of this world, 
thank you for blessing this land with cows, these small worms fill my heart with joy so much that even the shiny 
objects found here seem worthless.
I wish all my people can come to this place and see the beauty of the same. 
But I fell in love with something that no one talks about, guess I could let others have it.

We couldn't understand what is that something that our master is talking about.

Answer

Mango

Clue 2 -

Touka Kirishima`
